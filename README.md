# Slot Machine Game

This is a very basic slot machine game that was made using HTML, CSS and JAvascript.
It has 3 slots that contains different numbers. The number range is from 1 to 4.

This game has two states (win)  (lose). When you win you will see a message saying "JACKPOT" when you loose the message will be TRY AGAIN
it has 2 buttons one to PLAY and one RESTART that refreshes the page.

Here are some images on how the game works.
